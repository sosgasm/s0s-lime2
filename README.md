## Getting Started
So I got myself a superb quality singleboard computer and made it a project.
I use this server for multiple purposes: Sandbox, server, storage server...etc. 

For example: A friend got me a nfc reader + card. The best thing I could come up with, was connect the reader to my lime and make it run a script whenever I swipe my card. In this case it sends an email. It's still WIP. 
The best thing about this device is that I added a battery, which can be switched on when the Lime is unplugged from it's main power supply. So power failure proof.
