# Homeserver with Olimex Lime2 A20

## Getting Started
So I got myself a superb quality singleboard computer and made it a project.
I use this server for multiple purposes: Sandbox, server, storage server...etc. 

For example: A friend got me a nfc reader + card. The best thing I could come up with, was connect the reader to my lime and make it run a script whenever I swipe my card. In this case it sends an email. It's still WIP. 
The best thing about this device is that I added a battery, which can be switched on when the Lime is unplugged from it's main power supply. So power failure proof.

## The box
My idea of an arcade box was simple: A square or rectangle shaped box with a cut out window for a small monitor.

```
Cut out six rectangles to create the box:

* Cut out 6 rectangles with the following  dimensions: <todo:insert dimensions>
* Smoothen them with sandpaper as much as you want
* Take one of the planks with dimensions <todo: insert dimensions>
* Lay the front on the monitor on the plank to draw the outline
* Cut out the outline to create the placeholder for the monitor

Decoration:
* Paint the planks black. Maybe cut out a little outline for the monitor. As you can see in the picture I
cut out an outline and painted it silver. I put stickers on it after.
