## Getting Started
So, I got myself a superb quality singleboard computer and turned it into a project.
I use this server for multiple purposes: Sandbox, storage, webserver, and I've got Irssi running 24/7..etc. 

For example: A friend got me a nfc reader + card. The best thing I could come up with, was connect it to my DIY server and make it run a script that sends an email.
The best thing about this device is that I added a lithium battery that I can switch on whenever the Lime is unplugged from it's main power supply. The server doesn't lose it's power for a while.
